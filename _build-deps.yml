    # git-describe --always almost does what we want, but we need to connect the
    # ReleaseTag variable contents to how this build was triggered, which we
    # will find out using `Build.SourceBranch` (a pipeline varaible).
    #
    # Importantly, a few things are going on here:
    # - If we were triggered by a tag, we need to set ReleaseTag to exactly the
    #   tag name, so that the artifacts are named correctly. If we cannot do
    #   this, the build needs to fail rather than uploading artifacts to some
    #   other random tag.
    # - If we were triggered by a branch build, we need to be more careful, as
    #   tagged commits are also pushed to branches. Branch builds explicitly use
    #   the longer format so that if the built commit matches a tag, the
    #   ReleaseTag is not a tag name.
    #
    # This is partly caused by azure not always pulling down tags when checking
    # out a repo, so we fetch tags again, above, just to make sure we have all
    # current tags.
